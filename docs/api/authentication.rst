Authentication
==============

Inthe.AM relies upon you supplying your API key in the ``Authorization`` header; if your API key
was "MYAPIKEY", you would add the following header:

.. code-block:: none

  Authorization: ApiKey MYAPIKEY

You can find your API key in the "API Access" section of your Inthe.AM Configuration.
